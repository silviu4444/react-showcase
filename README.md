This project was developed from scratch (“first-hand”), without relying on pre-existing templates or boilerplates.  
The codebase focuses on clarity and demonstrating core skills rather than production-level perfection.

➡️ **There is room for improvement, refactoring, and optimization.**  
Areas that could be enhanced include:
- More modularization  
- More robust error handling  
- Better API structure  
- Additional testing and validation

While functional, it is intentionally kept straightforward and can be expanded or improved based on production needs.
